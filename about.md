My name is Jeff Smits. I'm a PhD Candidate at Delft University of Technology. You can find out more about me on my [personal website](http://www.jeffsmits.net/).

On this blog I write about my side-projects, not whatever I'm doing for work. I try to keep that separate, though obviously work can influence my choice of side-project.
